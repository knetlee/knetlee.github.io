                               <p>I currently live and work in Melbourne. I moved here lasst year after spending 6 years in New Zealand<br />
                               I grew up in Queensland on the Sunshine coast. I first got into IT in school, we used to code with mswlogo and <br />
                               since then  I have enjoyed coding alot, now with my job i have alot of exposure to arduino and RasberryPi. <br />
                               I decided to attened RMIT via OUA because I have studied with them before and its a goody way to study and work<br />
                               I hope to learn the foundations of IT to facillitate a career move into IT< p/>

                                      <p>Although I have no formal qualifications I have been studying through free learning sites 
                                      such as <i>linked in learning, coursera </i>and </i>edx for many years. <br />  The topics i have covered range from ancient
                                       history to thermodynamics. I have many interests and am a very curious person. I love to learn so IT is great
                                        because it is always changing<br /></p>
                                      <p>I like security in particular because of its wide reach. Everything needs security and I 
                                      have always enjoyed pentesting for fun on hack the box . </p>

		<h3 align="center"><b>Mobile firewall/security device (prototype using raspberrypi)</b></h3>
		</header>
		<p><b>Overview</b><br/>
The mobile firewall/security device is a compact but strong security tool. <br/>
It provides the user with a physical device loaded with software and hardware that monitors the connections between your user device and any network it is connected to.<br/>
 Its only purpose, the safety of your data. The Final product will be a self contained unit with an on board battery for portability. It will be able to connect multiple devices to the<br/>
  internet and monitor all traffic as well as being able to update it to keep up with constantly changing threats, ensuring that all your and your businesses data is kept safe.<br/>
  <br/>
<b>Motivation</b><br/>
In today's world of globalization and networking, online security is of the greatest importance. Every day we hear about data being stolen and companies being breached.<br/>
Not to mention the pervasiveness of free WIFI networks or public networks as well as private /home networks being used for sensitive data . Many people commute, work<br/>
 from home or work while traveling using these unsecured or lightly secured networks to upload and discuss private and confidential information. Even if you have your own <br/>
 mobile broadband or on board security software is not enough. A physical device that can alert you to any suspicious activities and actively take action to protect your data is another layer in good security.<br/>
<b>Description</b><br/>
A small device about the size of a credit card. It has a touch screen for input and alerts. LAN and WIFI connectivity and can easily monitor multiple connections at the same time while maintaining <br/>
By running a dedicated operating system the Mobile Firewalls does a more efficient job at ensuring your data safety whether it be with your online shopping or business projects.<br/>
 It connects to the network you wish to use and you connect your devices to it. It monitors traffic in and out of the network as per your settings, flagging and analyzing any suspicious activity.<br/>
  When a threat detected it will let you know and give you options on how to deal with the issue. However if when a treat is detected and deemed serious enough it will disconnect from your devices<br/>
   from the network terminating the connection before any data is compromised. More then just your basic antivirus of firewall all of the units processing power and hardware is focused on one job so it can <br/>
   identify many more threats then just antivirus or windows firewall. Having an on board battery allows it it be used anywhere and with anything. It will be USB charging so for those long projects or trips you can just plug it in and stay secure.<br/>
 Once you have setup the connection settings, just like your home router, it will automatically connect to your available device upon powering on. You can then use the touchscreen to log into the network you wish to connect to.<br/>
  By using the latest and most compact hardware the average user should not experience any disruption in normal use, by blocking unwanted traffic it can make your connection more efficient and certainly more secure. <br/>
As an optional feature you will also be able to use this device to run diagnostics on your home network.<br/>
 It can do basic scans of the network and look for any weak points. For this particular function the user will need some basic knowledge of testing wireless networks. <br/>
<br/>
<b>Tools and tech</b><br/>
By using already marketed tech like rasberryPi, atheros Wi-Fi dongles and a touchscreen for prototyping you could get a working device quite easily.<br/>
 Most of the software is open source and can be found on the internet. However the final product would be much smaller, more streamlined and contain an internal battery.<br/>
  Dedicated to the single purpose of security so many if the peripheral of PI would not be needed.<br/>
To prototype using RaspberryPI you would also need an SD card and Ethernet cable, power supply, keyboard and software.<br/>
 The software can be thing like arch Linux or Kali, any operating systems that can support the required features. Before setting up the prototype you will need to upload the<br/>
  software programs and drivers onto the SD card using your home computer. Once you have done that the rest of the setup takes place on the Pi. <br/>
You can then setup the device to your own personal requirements as with the final product. Operationally the prototype and final product would work the same way.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Skills required</b><br/>
To complete this project you need to have a working knowledge of raspberryPI and how to do basic coding. There are many instructions on how to achieve projects like this on places like YouTube and instructables.com, <br/>
each system is different and work to differing degrees and you will need to be able to trouble shoot and modify the project to get it working for you. <br/>
To create the intended end product you would need to have a working knowledge of hardware and software and how to get those things to work together.<br/>
 By using bare components you can build your own micro-controller in the style of pi but basic and streamlined for the purpose of the Mobile Firewall and power it with an internal battery rather the an power supply. <br/>
 You can even upgrade some components and make a more powerful mobile firewall dependent on the financial constraints of the project.<br/>
Coding and soldering skills would also be a must for success.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Outcome</b><br/>
The outcome of this project is a small mobile device that can add an extra layer to online security by protecting your personal and business data.<br/>
 I think it could have a large impact on data theft by getting the average person to a minimum level of security much higher then current standards. It can also help businesses protect their corporate data.<br/>
 The easiest way into a business is through its people, if every person had a set and forget solution it could stop many data breaches and protect the privacy of all users.<br/>
